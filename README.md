Calculate Azimuth and Zenith for complete day to day analysis.

Output will go into a table format.

This project has been interesting because of all the formats it's been through.
Originally it was written in MatLab for a class, then converted to pure HTML/Javascript for web formatting.
I've since then added AngularJS functionality which made the page run faster and look better.

Formulas are derived from the book: Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes
